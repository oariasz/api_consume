Objective: I am testing my Python API skills by building a project that uses the TMDB API. I created a Python class, MovieDB, to handle API requests and fetch movie data from TMDB. Now, I want to extend this project by creating a user-friendly, modern Streamlit-based UI.

Tasks:

Refactor Code:

Separate the MovieDB class implementation into its own file/module (e.g., moviedb.py). Use the MovieDB class as an import in the UI implementation. Streamlit UI:

Create a Streamlit UI that aligns with the provided design. The interface should: Be elegant and modern. Provide an intuitive user experience. Leverage the functionality of the MovieDB class for seamless API integration. Project Structure:

Refactor the project to ensure a clean, maintainable structure with separate files for the UI and API logic. Documentation:

Write a detailed README.md file, including: Project description and features. Step-by-step setup instructions. Clear usage instructions for both the MovieDB API and the Streamlit UI. Generate a requirements.txt file with all necessary dependencies. Environment Setup:

Provide instructions to: Create a Python virtual environment matching the current Python version I'm using. Install dependencies using the requirements.txt. Publishing to GitHub:

Include detailed steps for publishing the project to my GitHub account: oariasz.

Follow the best practices in system design and python coding.

DO NOT modify my MovieDB class implementation.
